## Printout Procedure using the canon printer
Now let us start with the further procedure in the installation of the printer i.e. to take a printout through the canon.com/ijsetup printer. To take a printout one has to look after various parameters after buying a printer. These parameters include Unboxing the product as well as sorting the various component, Downloading the drivers necessary, Installing the drivers, Loading the cartilage and drum, loading print papers, and the actual printout procedure. The first 3 steps are explained earlier. Now let’s see the further steps.

## Loading print papers in the canon.com/ijsetup printer
Some minute mistakes take place while you have a printout such as misplacing the paper. These mistakes lead to the displacement of the print from the desired place. So to avoid these type of the mistake the proper loading of the papers in the tray is mandatory. We provide the proper procedure to load the papers in the tray.

1. Open the front paper tray cover from your printer and observe all the marks available on the printer tray.
2. Now slightly pull the paper supporter towards your side and make sure that the pulling does not harm any part of the printer
3. Then open the pack or rim of the paper and make sure that the papers are not stuck to one another. If you observe such a thing then take the rim and bend it from both edges several times.
4. Now look at the mark of the pile of the paper in the paper tray and fill the papers in such a way that the mark remains visible to you.
5. Now see both the edges of the paper which are at the rear side so that they are not bent. This may lead to the paper jam condition.
6. Then look at the sides of the paper and adjust the side-adjuster according to the size of the paper. Don’t push it roughly as it will bend the sides of the paper and there will be a dome in between. This may lead to a misprint or else sometimes there will be no print.
7. Put the front adjuster and push the tray slightly behind so that there will be no bent in between.
8. This finishes the loading of the papers into the tray. Go for the print as it is explained in the steps given below.
